# TSP-and-SOM-morphological-approach
Considering a multivariate image $I$ and a metric $d$ on the space of values of $I$, two morphological approaches can be constructed: one through the solution of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the other through the self-organizing maps (SOM). The Jupyter Notebooks files show examples of these approaches.
